## Anscombe's quartet
This is an assignment for the module *Fundamentals of Data Analaysis* where I reproduce and comment one of the articles written by Francis John Anscombe in which he claimed the essential rol of graphic representations of data sets to have a more meaningful approach before dealing with these sets.

In order to run this Jupiter notebook I recommend to download the full repository to your local machine, open your command line, lead it to the repo folder and then run the command *Jupyter notebook* so that the browser executes it.

I handled the data in two different ways:
1) By entering the data sets manually
2) By loading it from a csv file (which is included in this repository) using pandas

If you have any issues related to the csv file I recommend you to download the whole repository and run it from your local machine. Just make sure the csv file is in the same folder as the Jupyter notebook file.

If the plots are not displayed properly I recommend you to add this command *%matplotlib* before the code of the plot.
